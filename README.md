As of 4th December 2018, I've released Global Offensive UI for free on GitHub.

Enjoy!

Global Offensive UI is a realistic reimagination of Counter-Strike: Global Offensive's main menu system, designed for server owners. You can customize this interface to your greatest needs and desires. It has in-depth customization with a client based settings panel and server-based configurations. It also features a fantastic UI with great animations and graphical fidelity.

# Features
- Supports **any gamemode**, no matter the complexity!
- Acts as an MOTD, or just a simple menu you can press with a hotkey.
- Great, optimized interface.
- Extreme customization for each element, and pages throughout the menu. Clientside settings that can be modified and (if required) disabled if the server owner does not want players to be able to customize.
- Categories for settings, which you can add yourself and remove yourself for any customization.
- Developer friendly, can implement callbacks for each element/page.
- Lightweight code.
- Easy to set up.
